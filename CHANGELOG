# Release 0.4.0
Several new features that I've wanted since LiuOS development started
* Elevation (like UAC but for LiuOS)
* Authentication for the `changecred` command
* Crash handler for LiuOS Apps
* Changelog for each release

Bug fixes:
* Fixed an issue where running `core.py` without running `setup.py` would cause an exception
* Fixed an issue where missing modules would result in an exception
